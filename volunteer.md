Stash has grown a lot and it is becoming very hard to keep up with day to day task that arrises for just the core develompment team. In light of that we are looking for some volunteers who love the project as much as we do and are willing to share a bit of time and allievate the pressure from the developers. 

People can take on more than one role if they wish. As long as it doesn't interfere with them performing other tasks.

### Linguistics Community Lead 
- Someone to take on the task of following up with our human translators to help encourage supported language completeness. 

### Documentation Community Lead
- Someone to take on the task and delegate sub-tasks to completion for ensuring that documentation is clear and concise. 
- Using tools such as AI, Markdown, Discord/Matrix and GitHub to ensure clear, concise, and useful communications across all of our supported technologies. 

### Project Manager
- This role is intended to focus on ensuring that tasks outside of bounties are managed and mapped in "timelines". 
- Ensuring that project scope and technical debt doesn’t creep out of control. 
- Managing expectations of the community and helping triage Pull Requests and community submitted issues.

### Community Liaison
- To some degree a moderator but primarily someone who dedicates time to ensuring people are politely encouraged and connected with the propitiate resources. This is someone who need to have a tremendous amount of patience and impartiality.
