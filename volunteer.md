title: Volunteer for Stash
heading: Self-Driven and Persistent Team Players
description: 
---

As we continue to grow and expand the Stash community, we seek individuals who are self-driven and persistent in their efforts to progress on project tasks. We are looking for team players who are:

- Capable: taking on new responsibilities and learning new skills quickly.
- Willing: persevering through challenges and setbacks and following up on tasks and issues that need attention.
- Inspiring: able to motivate and encourage others to work together towards a common goal.
- Patient: able to handle uncertainty and ambiguity with grace and understanding.
- Willing to speak up: when something seems unclear or if they feel like they are being misrepresented or underutilized.

Our goal is to create a team of individuals driven by a shared passion for the project and a commitment to its success and continuity. By working together, we can achieve great things and make a real impact on our community.

It's important to mention that we're looking to recruit redundant roles to ensure project continuity and prepare for different availability and potential contributor burnout.

If you believe you share these values and are interested in joining the Stash team as a volunteer, please submit your application and relevant experience to <b>stash-community-apps.xvb0n@simplelogin.com</b> or send a direct message on Discord to <b>BestagÏƒns#9203</b>.
