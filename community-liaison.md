As the Community Liaison Lead, you will be responsible for maintaining considerable patience and understanding with individuals from all walks of life. Your role requires a strong focus on neutrality in conversation and providing guidance rather than a heavy hand.

You will be responsible for the following:
- Writing in clear and concise English without using idioms or colloquialisms to be as understandable as possible to a broad audience.
- Interacting with community members in a politically neutral manner, focused purely on the project's goals.
- Looking for sticking points for community members and helping them find solutions, and bringing to the attention of the developers or other appropriate members of the team ways that they could engineer the landscape for more successful outcomes.
- Being as swift as possible and keeping potential disputes as private as possible while not making it impossible to follow up in disaster scenarios.
- Building relationships with team members rather than community-facing.
- Having an intimate knowledge of our platform ensures that you're focusing on being helpful when needed but not obligated to be responsive in every scenario all the time.

To be considered for this role, you should have the following:
- Strong communication skills, both verbal and written.
- A keen but impartial eye.
- Good understanding of the project goals and community needs.
- Strong focus on neutrality in conversation.
- Good knowledge of the platform.
